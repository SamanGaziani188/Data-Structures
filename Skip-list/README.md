# Homework 2

You have to create/fill/modify the following files:
- skiplist.py : implement SkiplistSet
- skiplist_list.py : implement SkiplistList and additional functions from the book
- skiplist_with_finger: implement SkiplistWithFinger as defined in the book
- main.tex: solve problems (adapted) from the book

As you solve more complicated programming problems, your code gets more complex and inevitably so do your bugs. Use the `pdb` module to help you debug. [Here is a simple tutorial](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/) to get you started.

Implementing __SkiplistWithFinger__ requires inheritance. [This tutorial](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_inheritance.php) covers most of the required syntax in Python.
