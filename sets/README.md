# CS 201 Data Structures II
## Homework 1: Interfaces

There are two parts to this homework.
- Programming: Implement the body of the functions in the `.py` files.
- Theory: Enter your solutions in `main.tex`. Your solutions should generally be concise but complete. If you need more than 10 lines to explain your solution, it is probably wrong.
You have to complete both parts.
