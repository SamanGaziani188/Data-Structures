# Homework 3

Solutions to many, if not all, of the graph problems can be easily found online. Do not fall into that trap. Agonizing over a problem to find its solution is an intended part of the assignment. It develops your capacity to think and problem solve, it is how learning happens, and it will help you in the exams. If you get stuck, do not get furstrated, take a break, do something else, [learn some Deutsch](https://www.deutsch-lernen.com), and come back with a fresh mind. Most of all, work on the problems with your buddy. Two minds are better than one, despite your brilliance.

Python files from the previous homework are included.
