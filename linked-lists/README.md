# CS 201 Data Structures II
## Homework 1

There are two parts to this homework.
- Theory: You will be solving questions from Chapters 2 and 3. Enter your solutions in `main.tex`. Your solutions should generally be concise but complete. If you need more than _20_ lines to explain your solution, it is probably wrong. You will be writing a lot of pseudocode. Explore some [LaTeX packages](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Algorithms) to help you write them.
- Programming: You will be implementing linked lists and their methods. Using your knowledge so far, you will also have to conceive of and implement a new data structure.

You have to complete both parts.

Be mindful of _source control etiquette_. Do not add any _automatically generated_ files to your repository. These include: ediotr autosaves, auxiliary LaTeX files, python generated files, and IDE generated files. It is best to list these in your `.gitignore` file so they do not show up in git's listings in the first place.

The homework is due by 19h on Monday, 29 Jan.
