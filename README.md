# Data-Structures
This is my repository for Data Structures using Python. 
This repository mainly aims at implementation and discuss the variations of different Data Structures using Python.

Important contents of this repository:

### Variations of Queue, Stack, Unsorted and sorted sets
  - Scenarios discussing the correct usage of Queue, Stack, Deque, USet, or SSet.
  - The relationship between [Dyck word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Dyck_word) and Stack.
  - Reversing the order of elements using a stack and queue data structure
  - [Link to the document](https://github.com/SamanGaziani188/Data-Structures/blob/master/Documents/Variations-of-Queue-Stack-Unsorted-and-sorted%20sets/main.pdf)

### Implementation of Unsorted set
  - Unsorted set implemented in python
  - test cases to verify correct implementation
  - [Link to Repository](https://github.com/SamanGaziani188/Data-Structures/tree/master/unsorted-set)
  
### Implementation of Sorted set
  - Sorted set implemented in python
  - test cases to verify correct implementation
  - [Link to Repository](https://github.com/SamanGaziani188/Data-Structures/tree/master/sorted-set)
  
### Variations of Array, Deque, Single Linkedlist and Double Linkedlist
  - Efficient add_all method for list implementation
  - Rotate function that rotates the list a so that a[i] moves to a[(i+r)mod length(a)]
  - Efficient variant of ArrayDeque
  - reverse() method that reverses the order of elements in a Single linkedlist
  - Roatate function that rotates a double linkedlist 
  - Designing a pseudocode showing how the bitwise exclusive-or operator can be used to swap the values of two integer variables without using a third variable.

### Implementation of MinDeque
  - Implementation of minDeque data structure that can store comparable elements and supports all the deque operations add_first(x), add_last(x), remove_first(), remove_last() and size(), and the min() operation, which returns the minimum value currently stored in the data structure. All operations should run in constant amortized time.

### Implementation of Single Linkedlist
  - Single Linkedlist implemented in python
  - test cases to verify correct implementation
