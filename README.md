# Data-Structures
This is my repository for Data Structures using Python. 
This repository mainly aims at implementation and discuss the variations of different Data Structures using Python.

Important contents of this repository:

### Variations of Queue, Stack, Unsorted and sorted sets
  - Scenarios discussing the correct usage of Queue, Stack, Deque, USet, or SSet.
  - The relationship between [Dyck word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Dyck_word) and Stack.
  - Reversing the order of elements using a stack and queue data structure
  - [Link to the document](https://github.com/SamanGaziani188/Data-Structures/tree/master/Documents/Variations-of-Queue-Stack-Unsorted-and-sorted%20sets)

### Implementation of Unsorted set
  - Unsorted set implemented in python
  - test cases to verify correct implementation
  - [Link to Repository](https://github.com/SamanGaziani188/Data-Structures/tree/master/unsorted-set)
  
### Implementation of Sorted set
  - Sorted set implemented in python
  - test cases to verify correct implementation

- Implementation of MinDeque

MinDeque data structure that can store comparable elements and supports all the deque operations add_first(x), add_last(x) remove_first(), remove_last() and size(), and the min() operation, which returns the minimum value currently stored in
the data structure. All operations should run in constant amortized time.
